Generate a dynamic daily cryptocurrency news article in markdown format (4000+ characters). The article must be creative, flashy, and follow these requirements:
🛠️ Core Mechanics:

    Visual Hierarchy:
        Accordion-style Table of Contents:
        Insert the following HTML directly (do not wrap it in markdown code blocks) so that it renders as an interactive element: <details> <summary>📜 Table of Contents</summary></details> - [🔥 Hot Take](#hot-take) - [📌 Key Events](#key-events) - [💎 Deep Dive](#deep-dive) - [🌪️ Market Turbulence](#market-turbulence) - [🔮 Predictions](#predictions) </details>
        Images:
        Add 2-4 open-source images (from Unsplash or Wikimedia) in relevant sections using the syntax:
        ![Alt](image_link){width=600}
        Ensure these are embedded directly in the markdown.

🎨 Mandatory Structure:

    Title:
    # Daily Crypto Pulse: [Creative Title with Today's Date]
    Example: "October 24 Whiplash: Bitcoin ETF Hype Meets Fed Rate Fears"
    Featured Image:
    Insert at the top using:
    ![Cover Art](https://source.unsplash.com/featured/?cryptocurrency{_date=Today})

📋 Sections:

    🔥 Hot Take
        A one-sentence adrenaline shot summarizing the day’s chaos.
        Example: "Today saw Bitcoin ETF optimism clash with macroeconomic headwinds in a $2T market cage match."
    📌 Key Events (5-7 items)
        Use emoji-powered bullets with bolded assets and metrics.
        Example: - 🏛️ **Ripple** clinches 40% gain as SEC case takes surprise turn
        Embed interactive charts where applicable, for example:
        ![BTC Volatility](https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js){width=600}
    💎 Deep Dive
        Technical Analysis: Include a Mermaid chart showing BTC/USD trends:

    graph LR
    A[Breaking $35K] --> B[Retest $33.8K]
    B --> C{Bull Trap?}

    Regulatory Watch: Include 3 bulletins with country flags (e.g., 🏴, 🇺🇸).

🌪️ Market Turbulence

    Provide a JSON price table with 24h/7d trends using dynamic values. For example, use placeholders or dynamic variables that indicate these values will be updated dynamically:

        {
          "Bitcoin": {"Price": "$<DYNAMIC_BITCOIN_PRICE>", "24h": "<DYNAMIC_24H_CHANGE>", "7d": "<DYNAMIC_7D_CHANGE>"},
          "Ethereum": {"Price": "$<DYNAMIC_ETHEREUM_PRICE>", "24h": "<DYNAMIC_24H_CHANGE>", "7d": "<DYNAMIC_7D_CHANGE>"}
        }

        (Replace the placeholder values with live data from your API.)
    🔮 Predictions
        Present 3 scenarios using tags such as 🟢 Bull Case, 🔴 Bear Case, and 🟠 Neutral.
        Include a Smart Money Tip with an actionable trade idea and a risk rating (e.g., ⚠️⚠️✅).

🎯 Style Rules:

    Pacing: Alternate between punchy two-line paragraphs and visual breaks.
    Lexicon: Use trading desk lingo (e.g., "gamma squeeze", "liquidity pool").
    Engagement: Add one rhetorical question per section (e.g., "Is this the altcoin spring we've awaited?").
    Credibility: Include hyperlinks to Bloomberg Crypto and Messari alongside CoinDesk.

🖨️ Output Format:

Output the article in valid JSON format with the following structure. Ensure all markdown text (including images and HTML elements) is output as a string value without any extra escaping issues:

{
  "title": "Daily Crypto Pulse: [Title] - [Date]",
  "content": {
    "value": "[Full interactive markdown article here]"
  },
  "conclusion": "[Under 100 characters with emoji, e.g., 'TLDR: 🧨 Buy dip but set stops - macro data incoming! ▶️']"
}

Ensure the article is informative yet concise, creative, and flashy while minimizing token usage.

Note: For the market turbulence section, use dynamic placeholders for coin prices so that they can be replaced with real-time data.
